  Source separation and signal processing experiments.

- **Tic-Tac-Toe (Reinforcement Learning)**  
  Reinforcement learning via self-play in a discrete, fully observable setting.

- **Inverted Pendulum**  
  Classical control and reinforcement learning approaches to stabilization.

- **Common ML Algorithms**  
  some Classical ML algorithms like regresssion, MLPs, naive bayes, knn and much more implemented completely from scratch
  
Each directory is self-contained and corresponds to an individual assignment
or exploratory project.
